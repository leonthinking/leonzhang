#### **Product Manager | Digital Enthusiast | Photography Lover | Blogger**

Hey there! I'm Leon, a Product Manager who is extremely passionate about all things tech. I'm a fan of Smartisan and Apple products.

Music-wise, I adore JJ Lin, especially his electrifying live performances. Photography is another love of mine—I enjoy capturing moments that tell compelling stories.

Aside from my professional endeavors, I express my thoughts, experiences, and insights through blogging.
